## 1. Introduction

The final project for this class will be focused on trending Youtube videos. Specifically, this project will be using a trending Youtube videos dataset (US only), and will be used to predict if a video will trend on Youtube. Trending videos on Youtube are aimed to surface videos to a wide range of audience whom find interesting. There are a lot of hypothesis people created to understand the Youtube algorithm, but there is no concrete proof or findings that can validate these thoughts. Additionally, Youtube content creators are constantly evolving and purposely tailoring their videos in hopes it will go viral. Creating Youtube videos that can appeal to a wide audience is difficult. Most people on Youtube have specific interests and follow certain industries, however; anyone can appreciate a good video.

## 2. Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a model to predict if a Youtube video will trend. Content creators, companies, or even one time users aim for their videos to reach the trending section on Youtube. Only 50 videos a day can reach the trending section on Youtube so it makes it very unlikely even a good video will reach the section. As stated earlier, the purpose of the trending section is to attract a wide range of audience but what if there is an easier way for a video to reach the section. For my model to predict if a video will trend I will be training my model on the trending youtube videos and after will be applied to all youtube videos. While training my model I will be constantly evaluating the validity of its findings and the accuracy. If this model is successful it can be used to increase the chances a video will trend on Youtube. 

## 3. Dataset
To understand what determines if a video will trend on Youtube the datasets chosen for this project are a trending Youtube videos (US) and a dataset of public Youtube videos. 

The model being built for this project will try to find commonalities within the trending youtube videos dataset. Some examples of commonalities this model can find are keywords within the title of videos, popular tags, likes:dislikes ratios, etc. This model will find the importance of what determines if a video will trend on Youtube. By understanding the ranking of importance of what makes or breaks a video to trend will allow the model to accurately assess the probability the video will trend. 
Afterwards, a confident model is built wihtin the trending dataset it will be applied onto the data set of public Youtube videos and will be evaluate how accurate the model is at predicting a trending Youtube video. To test if this works the datasets can be compared to find which video trended and if the dataset was able to predict the trending videos on the public videos dataset then it will be successful.

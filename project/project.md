Adam Chai INFO-I423 Professor Fox October 9, 2020 Final Project Planning

Team Currently I do not have a team for the final project. I tried using the, “Search for Teammates!” forum within Piazza, 
but it does not look like other people are searching for teammates. I could be wrong and maybe I am not looking in the right place to find teammates, 
but for now, I will be working on this project alone. Within the, “Search for Teammates!” forum I added a post about myself and contact information. 
If someone does contact me, I will try to form a team because I would rather work on the final project as a team rather than individually.

Topic/Dataset After looking through various data sets, I have determined the scope of my final project will be within the realm of finding unique 
insights/analysis within the data sets. These are the data sets I would want to work on for my final project:

https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new 
https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows

I am confident I can use any of these data sets, however; the one I am interested in the most is the Trending Youtube Video Statistics data set. 
The reason why I am interested in this the most is because Youtube is the figurehead for video content and is one of the most visited websites 
throughout the world. By using the extensive Youtube data set, I hope this project will be meaningful and I will learn more about data analysis. 
Some ideas I have for this project are finding characteristics for what makes a trending video, what factors into how popular a Youtube video will be,
or statistical findings. If I am able to another idea I have is to create a model that can predict if a video will trend on Youtube. The Netflix data set I 
was looking into appears to be interesting and is a data set I would use for my final project. 
Several topics I am interested in this data set are analysis of actors/directors across movies/series and the reasoning behind Netflix’s preference 
for movies over tv series. The New York City Airbnb data set is the last data set I am interested in focusing my project around. Various ideas I 
have for topics are predicting prices or locations for Airbnb or analysis determining why some areas are busier than others. To clarify confusion, 
I want to base my final project off the Youtube data set followed by Netflix then NYC Airbnbs.

What needs to be done to get a great grade To get a great grade in this assignment, or within any assignment, what needs to be done in preparation, 
asking for help, and working on the assignment as soon as possible. Preparing the assignment means going through what needs to be tackled first and 
completed to go on the next step. This also means I should lay out the steps and quantify how long it will take to go through each step. Arguably, 
the most important method of receiving a great grade is asking instructors for help. Instructors’ jobs are to help students and if I become stuck on 
a step, I cannot continue completing the project until the step is over. Whenever I need help, I will reach out to the instructors of this class promptly.
Finally, the final project needs to be started early, because there are many obstacles and learning curves, I cannot estimate correctly so I can 
finish in time. To prevent a late assignment starting early or right now will prevent me from losing points. By following these steps, I should be 
able to produce a high-quality assignment for this class.
